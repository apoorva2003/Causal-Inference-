Research Question & Literature

This study explores the causal impact of gasoline price fluctuations on public transit ridership
in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. While prior research has documented
correlations between fuel costs and transit usage, few studies have established a credible
causal relationship using high-frequency data and robust identification strategies. This study
addresses this gap by leveraging exogenous variation in global crude oil prices as an
instrumental variable for local gasoline prices.
The primary research question is:

1. How do fluctuations in gasoline prices causally affect public transit ridership in
Washington, D.C. area?
This question aims to identify the direction and magnitude of the cross-price elasticity
between gasoline and public transit usage. A key objective is to understand whether rising
fuel prices lead commuters to substitute toward public transit, and to what extent.

A probable secondary question (planned for future work) is:
2. Does the elasticity of transit ridership with respect to fuel prices differ across
income groups?
This question will be explored through future work that links transit station usage with
demographic and income data from the American Community Survey (ACS). Understanding
heterogeneity in fuel sensitivity across socioeconomic strata is crucial for designing equitable
and efficient transportation and energy policies.
By addressing these questions, the study plans to contribute to the broader literature on
transportation economics and public policy, providing empirical evidence that can inform
urban planning, climate resilience strategies, and social mobility frameworks.

This study employs an instrumental variables (IV) approach using a two-stage least squares
(2SLS) estimation strategy to identify the causal effect of gasoline price fluctuations on
public transit ridership in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The analysis exploits
exogenous variation in global crude oil prices as an instrument for local gasoline prices,
addressing potential endogeneity concerns such as reverse causality and omitted variable
bias.
